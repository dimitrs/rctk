- remove console.log dependency (make sure it works without firebug)
- jquery .empty() doesn't work with chrome?

Task serialization:

Due to the asynchronous nature of XHR, requests sent in a specific order
may not arrive in the same order on the server. This can be an issue when
a sync is sent before a change event: The change event may be handled before
the sync. In this case you'll see the change arrives *before* the sync, i.e.
... "HTTP/1.1 POST /b83bcbf0f15a11de915f0022fb9c772c/event" - 200 OK
... "HTTP/1.1 POST /b83bcbf0f15a11de915f0022fb9c772c/sync" - 200 OK

This can be solved in a number of ways:
- make syncs synchronous. In other words, don't do anything until the call
  is completed.
- somehow queue the communication *to* the server and verify the requests
  are sent in a specific order. I.e. either send the sync+event in a single 
  (ordered) request, or wait until the sync has finished before sending the
  change (similar to previous)
- use some sort of messagebus that supports this?
